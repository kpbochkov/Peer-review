# Peer_Review_2021

Project Description
The members of every organization are responsible for the quality of the products. One mechanism for self-regulation and coverage of the organization's standards is the peer work review system. This could be in many forms, but in general it is a peer review of the submitted work item - code, tests, documents etc. The workflow is usually the following: user submits some work (code, documentation), assigns a reviewer, the reviewer can comment, approve, request changes, or decline the work item. Once the reviewer approves the work item it is marked as complete.
The system should allow submitting work items, assigning other user as reviewer. The reviewer can add comments, request additional changes, approve, or decline the work item.
